# Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
# Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

# def rotate (nums, k):
nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k=3
print(nums[k+1:]+nums[:k+1])


# Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
# Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
# Explanation: 
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

nums = [-1,-100,3,99]
k = 2
print(nums[k:]+nums[:k])
