You are provided with the list of stock prices, and you have to return the buy and sell price to make the highest profit. 

Note: We have to make maximum profit from a single buy/sell, and if we canâ€™t make a profit, we have to reduce our losses. 

Example 1: stock_price = [8, 4, 12, 9, 20, 1], buy = 4, and sell = 20. Maximizing the profit. 

Example 2: stock_price = [8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], buy = 6, and sell = 5. Minimizing the loss.
