## Remove duplicates from sorted array
Given an integer sorted array in increasing order, remove the duplicate numbers such that each unique element appears only once. Make sure you keep the final order of the array the same.

Example 1: input array is [1,1,2,2], the function should return 2. 

Example 2: input array is [1,1,2,3,3], the function should return 3.
