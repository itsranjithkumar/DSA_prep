This question is quite straightforward but requires special attention to detail. We are provided with an array of positive integers. We have to find the maximum difference between j-i where array[j] > array[i].

Examples:

Input: [20, 70, 40, 50, 12, 38, 98], Output: 6  (j = 6, i = 0)
Input: [10, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 18, 0], Output: 8 ( j = 8, i = 0)
